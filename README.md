# My Neovim dotfiles

### Install

1. Download Neovim `>= v0.8.1`

NOTE: In future stable releases, I will leave a branch named `nvim-0.8.1` for
compatibility.

2. Clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim` or wherever you save your
   configuration.

3. Open Neovim. Packer will install itself.

4. Restart and run `:PackerSync` to make sure everything is installed.
